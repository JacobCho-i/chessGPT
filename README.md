## Play a chess against ChatGPT!
No matter how good you are at playing chess, ChatGPT is here to destroy you. 

The objective is trying to legitimately beat the ChatGPT in a chess duel. Since ChatGPT is more to a search engine AI than a chess AI, you might think it will be quick and easy fight vs ChatGPT. 

Wrong, not in this place. 

Here, we do not care about ChatGPT making some ridiculous moves. We will make every move ChatGPT makes even if it is an invalid move. If ChatGPT wants to move the knight diagonally, it will go diagonal. If ChatGPT wants to move the bishop that is no longer on the board, we will resurrect the bishop and make a move with it. 

Basically, you have to play normally to beat ChatGPT while ChatGPT can literally change the laws of chess. The chess rules no longer matter to ChatGPT. Can you survive from this absurd duel?
