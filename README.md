## Play a chess against ChatGPT!
No matter how good you are at playing chess, ChatGPT is here to destroy you. 

The objective is trying to legitimately beat the ChatGPT in a chess duel. Since ChatGPT is more to a search engine AI than a chess AI, the chance of it making invalid moves is high. 

However, we do not care in this place. We will make every move ChatGPT makes even if it is an illegal move. If ChatGPT wants to move knight diagonally, it will go diagonal. If ChatGPT wants to move bishop that is no longer on the board, we will revive the bishop and make a move. 

Can you survive from this absurd duel?
